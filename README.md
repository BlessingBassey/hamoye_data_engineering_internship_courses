## Courses proper
- `1st lesson` This is a `14 days Introduction to Python for Machine Learning course`, The course  explores how  machine learning techniques can be an invaluable tool for solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity - climate change. At the of this course, I worked  on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format. The jupyter note book `pandas` explains some of the techniques used (fully commented).
